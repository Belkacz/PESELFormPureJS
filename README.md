### About PESELFormPureJS

Pure JS PESEL validator is twin of another Pesel Validator created by me only in React hhttps://github.com/Belkacz/PESELFormReactJS
Js pesel validator was created first but the whole idea behind creating the same thing in two ways, was to show how relevant is react to create such things.
With only JS behind validator you need to refresh whole page to get an answer about what it's wrong, in react u got alert immediately.
